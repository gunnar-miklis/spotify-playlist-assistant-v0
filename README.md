# Spotify Playlist Assistant (Prototype v0)

Spotify Playlist Assistant is a simple interface that provides methods to interact with the Spotify API. It allows users to fetch playlists and their tracks, apply filters to refine the tracklist, and create new playlists based on the selected criteria.

## 🚀 Features

1. **Fetch** playlists and tracks from the Spotify API.
2. **Filter** playlists based on selected criteria.
3. **Create** new playlists and send them back to the Spotify API.
4. Light/Dark mode.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Frameworks

- TypeScript
- Next.js / React
- Next-Auth (**OAuth** with Auth.js)
- [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gunnar-miklis/spotify-playlist-assistant.git`.
2. Install dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`.
3. Create a Client App on the Spotify Web API website.
    - Follow this doc ([Spotify Web API Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/apps)) to create your application and generate the app credentials (CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET).
    - Set `Redirect URIs` to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify`.
4. Create a `.env` file and add the following environment variables:
    - `AUTH_SECRET`: auto-generate via `npx auth secret`.
    - `AUTH_SPOTIFY_ID` (Spotify Web API CLIENT_ID).
    - `AUTH_SPOTIFY_SECRET` (Spotify Web API CLIENT_SECRET).

## 🖥️ Usage

1. Start the development server: `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`.
2. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Sign in with your Spotify account via OAuth.
4. Explore the features and filters to create your new playlists.

## ✨ Motivation

- This project is on the one hand an educational learning project to help me expand my development skills (SSR and CSR with Next.js and TypeScript).
- And on the other hand, it's a fun hobby project. I've always wanted better filtering options for playlists in Spotify, but since they don't offer that feature, I decided to build it myself.
- It's a mix of learning something new and solving a problem I've personally wanted fixed for a while.

## 🧗‍♂️ Challenges and Learning Experiences

1. The biggest challenge for me, as someone who's used to develope with React  (purely client-side) was adapting to Next.js the hybrid full-stack approach. Getting a feel for how server and client connects, especially when mixing SSR with dynamic CSR, took some time to grasp. Having the server involved in state managment required to rethink how states or data fetching are handled on the client-side — such as using API routes or Server Actions.
2. Another significant challenge was working with the Spotify API. While it's feature-rich and offers a lot of functionality, the responses are large JSON objects, so I had to carefully pick out the relevant properties. Since each endpoint is designed to handle just a single specific task (I assume the API strictly follows the SOLID principles), I often needed to make several API calls to gather all the data required for just a single action in my application.
3. The file-based system (nested folder structures) initally felt complex. However it offers a lot of flexibility and organization as the project grows.
4. CSS modules was a new concept for me as well. They provide modularity, which is incredibly helpful when working with individual components, making styling more manageable.

## 💭 Future Ideas

- Add more filters.
  - this needs extra Api calls, since the cool filters ("dancebility", "loudness", "energetic", etc.) need an api call for EACH track.
- Pagination: lazy/auto loading.
- Style the OAuth redirect page.
- Allow the user to make new created playlist public.
  - Prompt when creating playlist: "Do you want to share this playlist with everyone?"
  - Database will store the information (use Prisma ORM).
  - Playlist page will be splitted into "Private playlist" and "Public playist".
